| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Monitoring**   | `htop`                                 | View live CPU, RAM, swap, processes      | Lightweight, recommended for quick terminal-based monitoring        |
|                         | `glances`                              | All-in-one stats view                    | ‚ùå Not recommended: Heavy & pulls large Python dependencies          |
| **Uptime Monitoring**   | [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) | Website uptime tracking with alerts      | Free for basic use, checks every 5 mins, alerts via email/Telegram  |
| **External Monitoring** | `netdata.cloud`                        | Full-stack metrics via browser dashboard | Monitors CPU, RAM, disk, MySQL, NGINX, WP, etc. Uses Netdata agent  |
|                         | External tools                         | Like Pingdom, BetterUptime, etc.         | üõë Be mindful: these consume **server resources** via HTTP ping/API |

## System Monitoring Tools

### `htop` (Recommended)

```bash
sudo apt install htop
htop
```

* Colorful UI
* Sort by CPU, Memory, PID
* Real-time process monitoring
* Easy to kill/renice processes

---

### `glances` (Not Recommended)

```bash
sudo apt install glances
```

* Heavy dependencies (Python + psutil, etc.)
* Not ideal for lightweight or production servers

---

## Website Monitoring (Uptime)

### [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com)

* External HTTP(S) monitoring every 5 minutes
* Email/Slack/Telegram alerts
* Great for monitoring your **WordPress site availability**
* Doesn't require installing anything on your server

---

## External Server Metrics

### External Monitoring Tools (e.g., BetterUptime, Pingdom)

* Useful for availability and latency reports
* Often **poll the server** frequently ‚Üí extra resource usage
* Some charge for frequent checks or advanced features

---

## `Netdata.cloud`

* Web-based dashboard
* Supports MySQL, NGINX, PHP-FPM, system metrics
* Requires installing **Netdata Agent** on the server

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
```

* Can connect to [netdata.cloud](https://netdata.cloud) for central dashboard
* Auto-detects many services
* **Recommended if**:

  * You want visual dashboards
  * You have enough system resources (RAM/CPU)
* **Not recommended for ultra-minimal setups**

---

## Final Advice

* Use **`htop` + UptimeRobot** for low-resource, essential monitoring.
* Consider **Netdata** for richer dashboards if your server can afford it.
* Avoid over-monitoring ‚Äî external tools **can strain small VPS setups**.
* Use `cron` + `logrotate` + monitoring scripts for DIY health checks.
