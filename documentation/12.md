# **Configuring `backlog` in Nginx Listen Directive**

## **Purpose**

To configure the `backlog` parameter in Nginx for controlling the maximum length of the queue of pending connections. This setting helps prevent dropped or refused client connections under high traffic by increasing the connection queue size at the OS level.

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Navigate to Nginx Site Configuration Directory**

```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
```

All site-specific configurations are typically stored here.

---

### 2. **Edit the Site Configuration File**

Replace `example.com.conf` with the actual configuration file for your site:

```bash
sudo nano example.com.conf
```

---

### 3. **Modify the `listen` Directive with `backlog` Option**

Inside your server blocks, adjust the `listen` directives as follows:

#### HTTP Server Block

Locate:

```nginx
listen 80;
```

Change to:

```nginx
listen 80 backlog=2048;
```

#### HTTPS Server Block

Locate:

```nginx
listen 443 ssl;
```

Change to:

```nginx
listen 443 ssl backlog=2048;
```

This configuration increases the OS-level TCP connection queue to 2048, reducing the likelihood of dropped connections when under heavy load.

---

### 4. **Note on `backlog` Behavior Across Sites**

The `backlog` setting is applied at the socket level. When it is configured for one virtual host (site), it applies to all other sites listening on the same IP and port, because they share the same underlying socket. You do **not** need to reapply `backlog` in every site configuration.

---

### 5. **Restart or Reload Nginx**

After making changes, validate and reload the configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

## **Best Practices**

* Use `backlog` values based on expected traffic; default system limits may be low (e.g., 128).
* Ensure that the OS-level `somaxconn` value supports the desired backlog:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn
```

You may increase it if necessary:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=2048
```

To make it persistent:

```bash
echo "net.core.somaxconn=2048" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

* Only apply the `backlog` setting to one socket per IP\:port pair to avoid redundant configurations.
* Test Nginx configuration after every edit to avoid misconfigurations.
* Monitor Nginx logs (`/var/log/nginx/error.log`) for any signs of connection queue overflows.
