# **Server Maintenance Schedule Summary**

## **Purpose**

To define a consistent and proactive maintenance schedule for ensuring server stability, security, and performance for a WordPress-based hosting environment. This structured routine helps minimize downtime, reduce vulnerabilities, and improve site responsiveness.

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Server Updates**

* **Frequency:** 3 times per week
* **Description:** Apply operating system and security patches using the systemâ€™s package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu). Includes kernel, utility, and daemon updates.

### 2. **WordPress Updates**

* **Frequency:** 3 times per week
* **Description:** Update core WordPress files, themes, and plugins. Ensure compatibility and verify after update.

### 3. **Site Backups**

* **Frequency:** Daily
* **Description:** Perform full backups of web files and databases. Store backups offsite or in a secure, redundant location.

### 4. **Virus and Malware Scanning**

* **Frequency:** Weekly
* **Description:** Scan server files and WordPress installations using tools like `ClamAV`, `rkhunter`, or Wordfence for malicious files or vulnerabilities.

### 5. **DBMS Tuning**

* **Frequency:** Every 60 days
* **Description:** Analyze and optimize database performance (e.g., MySQL/MariaDB) using tools like `mysqltuner`, query optimization, and index reviews.

### 6. **PHP-FPM Tuning**

* **Frequency:** Every 3 days
* **Description:** Adjust `pm.max_children`, `pm.max_requests`, and other parameters based on traffic analysis to optimize PHP-FPM performance and reduce memory usage.

### 7. **Disk Space Administration**

* **Frequency:** Weekly
* **Description:** Monitor and manage disk usage with tools like `df`, `du`, and cleanup utilities (`apt autoremove`, `journalctl`). Prevent unexpected outages due to full partitions.

### 8. **OPcache Administration**

* **Frequency:** Weekly
* **Description:** Monitor and flush OPcache to maintain PHP performance. Adjust memory allocation and validate script caching behavior.

## **Best Practices**

* Automate recurring tasks using cron jobs or Ansible scripts.
* Use logging and alerting for failed updates or backups.
* Perform updates in a staging environment before applying to production.
* Maintain versioned backups and test restoration periodically.
* Document all tuning changes for reproducibility.
* Secure backup storage and use encryption where applicable.
* Periodically review and refine the maintenance schedule based on server load and performance trends.
