# **MariaDB InnoDB Database Tuning**

## **Purpose**

To optimize MariaDB performance by tuning InnoDB-related parameters such as `innodb_log_buffer_size`. This process should be performed only once every 60–90 days, based on actual usage patterns. It requires caution to avoid InnoDB table corruption.

---

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Check Current InnoDB Buffer Pool Usage**

Begin by analyzing current memory usage by the InnoDB buffer pool:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

In the MySQL prompt:

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_data';
EXIT;
```

This shows the actual memory in use by InnoDB's buffer pool. Use this data to assess whether further tuning is needed.

---

### 2. **Edit the MariaDB Configuration File**

Before making any changes, **stop the MariaDB service** if modifying sensitive InnoDB directives such as `innodb_log_file_size`. Failure to do so may result in **InnoDB table corruption**.

Navigate to the configuration directory:

```bash
cd /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d
sudo nano 50-server.cnf
```

In the `[mysqld]` section (scroll to the bottom or where other `innodb_` settings are), add or modify:

```ini
innodb_log_buffer_size = 32M
```

> You may also find or set `innodb_log_file_size` here. If you need to change that directive, **stop MariaDB first**, modify the config, and then start the service again. Never restart MariaDB without stopping it when this parameter is modified.

---

### 3. **Restart MariaDB**

Once the required settings are updated:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
```

Ensure the service restarts without errors. You can check the service status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

## **Best Practices**

* **Modify InnoDB log file size only with proper precautions**:

  * **Stop MariaDB** before making changes to `innodb_log_file_size`.
  * Modify the configuration file.
  * Start the MariaDB service after changes.
* **Schedule this tuning task** only once every 60–90 days. Frequent changes to core buffer or log sizes can lead to instability.
* **Monitor logs** at `/var/log/mysql/error.log` after restarting the service to detect misconfigurations or recovery issues.
* **Document all changes** to `50-server.cnf` along with timestamps and reason for tuning.
* **Test changes on a staging or replica database first** before applying to production.
* **Back up all databases** prior to making any configuration changes.
