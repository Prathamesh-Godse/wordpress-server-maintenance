# **MariaDB Database Health Monitoring and Optimization**

## **Purpose**

To monitor database health, analyze InnoDB usage patterns, and perform basic optimization and repair operations using built-in MariaDB tools. These diagnostics help inform long-term tuning decisions and improve overall performance and reliability.

---

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Access the MariaDB Shell**

Start by logging into the MariaDB shell:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

---

### 2. **Analyze InnoDB Buffer Pool Usage**

View the actual memory used by the InnoDB buffer pool:

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_bytes_data';
```

This value indicates how much data is currently held in the buffer pool. It helps evaluate whether the buffer pool is appropriately sized.

---

### 3. **Assess Database Size**

View total size of all databases:

```sql
SELECT table_schema AS "Database", 
       ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS "Size (MB)" 
FROM information_schema.tables 
GROUP BY table_schema;
```

View total size for databases using only the InnoDB engine:

```sql
SELECT table_schema AS "Database", 
       SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024 AS "Size (MB)" 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE engine = 'InnoDB' 
GROUP BY table_schema;
```

---

### 4. **Buffer Pool Usage by Database (InnoDB Only)**

Determine how buffer pool memory is distributed across InnoDB databases:

```sql
SELECT table_schema AS "Database", 
       SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024 AS "Size (MB)" 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE engine = 'InnoDB' 
GROUP BY table_schema;
```

---

### 5. **I/O Statistics by Table**

Use performance schema to evaluate read/write operations and table-level I/O latency:

```sql
SELECT object_schema AS 'Database',
       object_name AS 'Table',
       COUNT_READ AS 'Reads',
       COUNT_WRITE AS 'Writes',
       SUM_TIMER_READ / 1000000000 AS 'Read Time (ms)',
       SUM_TIMER_WRITE / 1000000000 AS 'Write Time (ms)' 
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table 
ORDER BY SUM_TIMER_READ + SUM_TIMER_WRITE DESC;
```

This helps identify which tables are under the most load and may benefit from indexing or schema adjustments.

Exit the MariaDB shell:

```sql
EXIT;
```

---

### 6. **Optimize and Repair All Databases**

Run the following maintenance commands to clean up and repair database tables:

#### **Optimize All Databases**

```bash
sudo mysqlcheck --optimize --all-databases
```

This rebuilds tables and updates index statistics, potentially improving query performance.

#### **Auto-Repair and Check All Databases**

```bash
sudo mysqlcheck --auto-repair --check --all-databases
```

This checks and repairs tables that have errors or corruption.

> **Note**: These operations can temporarily lock tables. Avoid running during peak usage periods.

---

## **Best Practices**

* **Run diagnostics and optimization commands during off-peak hours** to reduce performance impact.
* **Monitor I/O-heavy tables regularly**, and consider adding indexes or partitioning for optimization.
* **Use buffer pool data** to justify changes to `innodb_buffer_pool_size` or related tuning directives.
* **Avoid making structural InnoDB changes without backups**.
* **Log and store outputs** of optimization and checks for auditing and trend analysis.
* **Combine this diagnostic process with periodic performance schema queries** to build an ongoing performance profile of the system.
