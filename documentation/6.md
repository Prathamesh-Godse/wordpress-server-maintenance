# **RKHunter â€“ Rootkit and Backdoor Detection**

## **Purpose**

To detect known rootkits, backdoors, and possible local exploits on Linux systems using RKHunter (Rootkit Hunter). This utility helps maintain system integrity by scanning for suspicious files and unexpected behaviors. Use cautiously and review logs regularly.

---

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Install RKHunter**

Install via APT:

```bash
sudo apt install rkhunter
```

---

### 2. **Initialize the File Properties Database**

Before performing scans, populate the RKHunter file property database. This creates a reference snapshot of system files to compare against during future scans.

```bash
sudo rkhunter --propupd
```

> Only run this command after verifying the system is in a trusted state. It updates baseline values (hashes, permissions, etc.) for critical files.

---

### 3. **Run a Full Scan**

Execute a full system check:

```bash
sudo rkhunter --checkall --sk
```

* `--checkall`: Runs all available tests.
* `--sk`: Skips keypress prompts to allow non-interactive execution.

---

### 4. **Review Scan Results**

RKHunter logs its output for later review. Use either of the following to inspect the log:

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/rkhunter.log
```

or, for easier navigation:

```bash
sudo less /var/log/rkhunter.log
```

Look for entries marked `[Warning]` or `[Rootkit]` to identify suspicious activity.

---

### 5. **Disable Default Cron Jobs (Optional)**

By default, RKHunter may install cron jobs to run automated checks. If you prefer manual control or custom scheduling, remove its default cron entries:

```bash
cd /etc/cron.daily/
sudo rm rkhunter

cd /etc/cron.weekly/
sudo rm rkhunter
```

---

## **Best Practices**

* **Run scans manually** after major updates or system changes.

* **Do not blindly trust scan results**: RKHunter may produce false positives. Review logs carefully before taking action.

* **Do not run `--propupd` regularly** without justification, as it overwrites the baseline used for comparison.

* **Consider logging scans with timestamps** and storing them offsite for audit purposes.

* **Restrict log access** using file permissions to avoid tampering:

  ```bash
  sudo chmod 600 /var/log/rkhunter.log
  sudo chown root:root /var/log/rkhunter.log
  ```

* **Harden your system further** by combining RKHunter with additional tools (e.g., ClamAV, AIDE, or manual audits).
