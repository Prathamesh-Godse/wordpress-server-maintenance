# **Virus and Malware Scanning with ClamAV**

## **Purpose**

To perform periodic virus and malware scans on a Linux server using ClamAV. This enhances system security by identifying potentially malicious files. The scanning process should be used with caution due to its high resource consumption.

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Install ClamAV**

Update your package lists and install ClamAV:

```bash
sudo apt update
server_updates
sudo apt install clamav
```

> **Note**: ClamAV’s virus definition database will update automatically during installation.

---

### 2. **Disable Automatic Database Updates**

ClamAV includes a service called `clamav-freshclam` that runs in the background to keep the signature database updated. On production servers, this service can consume considerable resources and is best disabled if you prefer manual updates.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop clamav-freshclam
sudo systemctl disable clamav-freshclam
```

---

### 3. **Manually Update Virus Definitions**

Run `freshclam` manually to download the latest virus definitions:

```bash
sudo freshclam
```

This ensures ClamAV is using the latest known malware signatures before running scans.

---

### 4. **Perform a System Scan**

> **Important Note**: ClamAV scans can significantly increase CPU and memory usage. Open `htop` in another terminal to monitor server load before initiating a scan.

Run a recursive scan on a specified directory:

```bash
sudo clamscan -r /path/2/scan
```

Common example:

```bash
sudo clamscan -r /var/www/
```

Options you may use with `clamscan`:

* `--remove=yes` – Deletes infected files (use with caution)
* `--log=/path/to/logfile.log` – Logs output to a file
* `--bell` – Produces a sound on detection (useful locally)

Example with logging:

```bash
sudo clamscan -r /var/www/ --log=/var/log/clamav/scan_$(date +%F).log
```

## **Best Practices**

* **Use on-demand scanning only**: Avoid scheduled full scans during peak traffic hours to minimize performance impact.
* **Limit scan targets**: Focus scans on user-upload directories, email spools, or public-facing folders.
* **Disable `clamav-freshclam`** if manual control over resource usage is required.
* **Keep virus definitions up to date** before every scan to maintain scan reliability.
* **Use log files** to monitor and audit results after each scan.
* **Test before using `--remove`**: Always run scans without deletion first to prevent false positives from destroying important files.
