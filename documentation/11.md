# **Administering Disk Space on Ubuntu Server**

## **Purpose**

To ensure consistent server performance and prevent downtime due to low disk space by actively monitoring and managing storage usage on an Ubuntu server. This includes identifying large files and directories, cleaning unnecessary packages, and managing logs.

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Check Disk Usage**

Use the `df` command to view current disk usage in a human-readable format.

```bash
df -h
```

This displays how much space is used and available on mounted filesystems.

### 2. **Clean Up Unused Packages and Cache**

Remove unneeded packages and clean up package cache using:

```bash
sudo apt autoremove && sudo apt clean
```

This helps free up space occupied by old dependencies and cached `.deb` files.

---

### 3. **Clean System Logs**

To reduce the size of system logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1days
```

This command removes journal logs older than one day. You can adjust the `--vacuum-time` argument as needed.

---

### 4. **Analyze Directory Sizes**

Use `du` to identify space usage by directories.

#### Check root-level directory sizes:

```bash
cd /
du -ah --max-depth=1 | sort -h
```

#### Drill down into specific directories (sorted by size):

```bash
cd /var
du -ah --max-depth=1 | sort -h

cd /var/www
du -ah --max-depth=1 | sort -h

cd /lib
du -ah --max-depth=1 | sort -h
```

> **Important:** Never delete files in the `/lib` directory. It contains essential shared libraries and kernel modules.

## **Best Practices**

* **Regularly monitor** disk usage using `df -h` and `du`.
* **Avoid filling up** system partitions, especially `/`, `/var`, and `/boot`.
* **Never delete** critical system directories like `/lib`, `/usr`, `/etc`, or any contents unless you are absolutely sure.
* **Automate clean-up** via cron jobs or systemd timers for logs and package cache.
* **Investigate anomalies** â€” sudden increases in disk usage may signal a misbehaving process or log flooding.
* **Backup important files** before manual cleanup.
* **Use log rotation** (`logrotate`) to manage growing log files.
