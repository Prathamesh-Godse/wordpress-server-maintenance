# **Server Updates Automation**

## **Purpose**

To streamline and automate the process of updating, upgrading, and cleaning up an Ubuntu-based server using a custom alias and a reusable bash script.

## **Structured Document**

### 1. **Manual Update Command Execution**

Navigate to the home directory and run the update commands manually:

```bash
cd
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt autoremove
```

This sequence:

* Updates the package index.
* Upgrades all installed packages.
* Removes obsolete dependencies.

### 2. **Create a Shell Alias for Routine Updates**

Open the alias configuration file:

```bash
nano .bash_aliases
```

Add the following alias:

```bash
alias server_updates='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y'
```

Save and exit. Reload the shell or run `source ~/.bash_aliases` to activate the alias. From now on, you can execute:

```bash
server_updates
```

### 3. **Create a Reusable Bash Script**

Navigate to your home directory and create a folder for your server scripts:

```bash
cd
mkdir server_bash_scripts
cd server_bash_scripts
```

Create and edit the update script:

```bash
nano server_updates.sh
```

Paste the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if script is run as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run this script with sudo or as root."
  exit
fi

# Update package lists
echo "Updating package lists..."
sudo apt update

# Upgrade installed packages
echo "Upgrading installed packages..."
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Remove unnecessary packages
echo "Removing unnecessary packages..."
sudo apt autoremove -y

echo "Update, upgrade, and autoremove completed."
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x server_updates.sh
```

Run the script with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo ./server_updates.sh
```

## **Best Practices**

* **Always review packages** before upgrading on production systems. Consider using `apt list --upgradable` to preview updates.

* **Use aliases cautiously**, especially with `-y` flags, to avoid unintended upgrades.

* **Run as root**: Ensure scripts that modify the system run with root privileges for full access.

* **Log updates**: For critical systems, redirect output to a log file for future auditing:

  ```bash
  sudo ./server_updates.sh | tee -a ~/update_logs.txt
  ```

* **Test scripts** on staging environments before using them on live servers.

* **Review autoremove output** periodically to prevent accidental removal of desired packages.
